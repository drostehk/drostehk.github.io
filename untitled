Kevan worked on it for two weeks.

There's an end-client , Motorola Solutions.

Objective : Design a marketing campaign, after 14 - 18 months the batter won't be able to charge anymore, so pick out those customers from the dataset , then blast them with battery upgrades after 14-18 months.

Consider that it's a rolling list. :)

* automated emails , targetted emails
* call center, targetted calls


What's maintenance?
What's the pipeline

The other selling opportunity is to find 'analog' customers and consider 'digital'


1. What are the exclusions.
  * TODO : Ask Adrien (Singpore)
2. What's the N/A catergory
  * Charges etc
3. What did you mean with `how customer bought in each year`.
  * Purchase Volume and Frequency
  * Customer Clustering // Segmenting
4. What about the other sheets, human facing.
  * Go ahead and ignore those.
5. Human vs Automated for the Data cleaning
  * They got rid of their distirbutor, so handed over their dataset
  * "Automation sounds great" - 
    * TODO : Present the automation of data refresh /
    * TODO price it out.


Timeline : Have it done ASAPPP Practically Potentially Possible.
TODO : Inform them about the timeline. 

## IDEAS 

Recreate the 'summary page', but build it up as a time series.
  * Columns are years, but also who the difference between current year and last, and calculate a projected value for this year (look at the percentage share of the yearly purchases per month, and extrapolate accordingly based on YTD purchases)
