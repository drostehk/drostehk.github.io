### Cronic Pain ###

I was feeling pretty good. A little too good. Reality walked up and put a foot right in my omelette.

I just needed to setup my fancy new Pelican build command as a cron job. I whipped up a little shell script (<span class="mdinlinecode">siteregen2.sh</span>) to load the virtualenv and run Pelican.

    :::bash
    #!/bin/bash
    ### Switch to the virtualenv and activate
    cd /home/macdrifter/virt_env/pelican3.2/
    source bin/activate
    ### Write to a log file. Let's log which version of Pelican is doing the work.
    which pelican >> /home/macdrifter/macdrifter_cron.log 2>&1
    pelican --version >> /home/macdrifter/macdrifter_cron.log 2>&1
    ### Kick that Pelican into action by pointing it at the config file and log the output
    /home/macdrifter/virt_env/pelican3.2/bin/pelican -s /home/macdrifter/virt_env/pelican3.2/pelican.conf.py >> /home/macdrifter/macdrifter_cron.log 2>&1
    ### Timestamp that bad boy.
    echo "siteregen2.sh: $(date)" >> /home/macdrifter/macdrifter_cron.log 2>&1

I added a line to my crontab so the site regenerates every 5 minutes:

    :::bash
    */5 * * * * sh ~/pelican_config/siteregen2.sh

Now, let's bask in the glow of our cleverness:

![Some bad encoding](http://www.macdrifter.com/uploads/2013/05/Screen%20Shot%2020130501_185355_std.jpg)

Nope. That's not right. Let's try 100's of other things, break all of our cron jobs and contact Webfaction support to display the depths of our ignorance. Check.

Finally, I took a trip over to the infinitely helpful Pelican IRC channel.

#### Salvation ####

One thing I love about Pelican, is the development team. They are friendly and eager to help. [Joining the IRC discussion](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pelican&uio=d4) feels like chatting at the bar. No criticsm, trolling or belittling. Just a bunch of people that like the same kind of things.

Within a couple of minutes of posting my error message several people joined in to offer suggestions. "Avaris", on the channel, figured it out right away.[^gittip] Cron knows shit about where it's running. It doesn't even know its locale.

[^gittip]: This was the first time I used [Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/avaris/). This is why Gittip exists.  

One line addition to the top of the script fixed the issue:

    :::bash
    #!/bin/bash
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    ### Switch to the virtualenv and activate
    cd /home/macdrifter/virt_env/pelican3.2/
    source bin/activate
    ### Write to a log file. Let's log which version of Pelican is doing the work.
    which pelican >> /home/macdrifter/macdrifter_cron.log 2>&1
    pelican --version >> /home/macdrifter/macdrifter_cron.log 2>&1
    ### Kick that Pelican into action by pointing it at the config file and log the output
    /home/macdrifter/virt_env/pelican3.2/bin/pelican -s /home/macdrifter/virt_env/pelican3.2/pelican.conf.py >> /home/macdrifter/macdrifter_cron.log 2>&1
    ### Timestamp that bad boy.
    echo "siteregen2.sh: $(date)" >> /home/macdrifter/macdrifter_cron.log 2>&1
