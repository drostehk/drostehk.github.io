Over the weekend, I updated my Pelican installation from v2.8 to [v3.2](http://blog.getpelican.com/pelican-3.2-released.html). I tested the new version for a couple of days and was anxious to get on the new hotness. Previously, I tried to go to Pelican 3.0 but site regeneration was painfully slow for me. Version 3.2 handled my 1800 posts like a champ.

I thought I'd share some tips and describe (again) how I'm using Pelican to run this site.

### Background ###

[Pelican is a static blogging system](https://pelican.readthedocs.org/en/3.2/) written in Python. Markdown files go in and HTML files come out. In the middle there are [Jinja2 templates](http://jinja.pocoo.org), JS and CSS that make everything look pretty. When a new post is added to a Pelican blog, the entire site is regenerated. This is necessary (right now) because the index and archive needs to be recreated from scratch. Typically, rebuilding a Pelican blog takes less than 10 seconds.

Many Pelican users only rebuild their site when they add some new content. Most of them do this from their Mac and upload the updated files to their host. I don't work that way.[^asshole] I like to write from anywhere that [I can get to my Dropbox folder][hazelsetup] of text files. That also means working from iOS.[^previous]

[^asshole]: Maybe it's because I like to be different. Maybe I just like to make things hard for myself.

### Virtualenv ###

I did future-me a huge favor. I decided to use Python's [Virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) for Pelican 3.2. I figured this would make upgrades much easier.[^py3] I could install an entirely new version of Pelican alongside my existing version without interuption. When I want to switch-over, I just change my build script to use the new virtualenv.

[^py3]: Right now Pelican works perfectly on Python2.7. Some day it may require Python3. Virtualenv would make that switch pretty easy. It only takes one extra flag and parameter to build a new virtualenv with a different version of Python.

Setting up virtualenv is pretty straight forward. First you install the tool and then you install the environment. There are [plenty][intro] of resources around to [figure this out][basics]. I performed the following installation on my host, [Webfaction][webfaction], through a SSH session.

    :::bash
    pip install virtualenv
    mkdir virt_env
    virtualenv virt_env/pelican3.2
    cd virt_env/pelican3.2
    source bin/activate
