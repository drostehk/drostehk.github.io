      <div class="content">
          <h2>Company Intro</h2>
          <div>
            Droste is based in Hong Kong and was established as a data science consultancy in 2014. 
          </div>
          <div class="ui center aligned inverted segment">
            <h2><b>Droste</b> is a Data Science Consultancy</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
          Data Science is an approach to extracting knowledge and insights from complex data. We have a proven track record creating value by applying data science in the retail and finance sectors. </br>
          </div>
          <div>
          In retail, we optimized a jewelry company's inventory based on gold price fluctuations; and enabled self-service analytics for world's leading consumer goods sourcing company. </br>
          </div>

          <div>
          In finance, we've helped wealth managers mitigate risk with our portfolio management system; developed a global FX rates service for eCommerce; and designed a credit scoring algorithm for a P2P lending company using mobile and social media data.  
          </div>
          <div class="ui center aligned inverted segment">
            <h3>
              Human intelligence and expertise have remain essential to creating value from data.</h3> Droste combines human ingenuity with sophisticated analytical techniques to identify opportunities for your business.
          </div>
          <div>
            We understand that data challenges aren't purely technical or sometimes even about data. Value is created with a deep understanding of your operations, domain and the opportunities they present. We design our engagements to closely integrate with your existing business and to grow its capacity for gainful outcomes. Enabling data-driven decisions, however, requires a diverse set of skills. That's why our team of data professionals draw their expertise across design, tech, analytics and business. Data Science only becomes effective at the intersection of these domains.
            
          </div>
          <div class="ui center aligned inverted segment">
            <h2>It is our mandate to deliver on the great promise of data.</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            As it is challenging to fine-tune the required skills mix, established organisations often struggle to compose effective data science teams. Droste benefits those organisation by lending its expertise in machine learning, data architecture, and data strategy. We complement existing teams and work closely with management to devise and execute on end-to-end data solutions.
